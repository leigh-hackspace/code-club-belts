# General Rules

* No one has a right to a belt - it must be earned. No [grandfather clauses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_clause).
* We (mentors, parents and all club members) will help you get there.
* We will be clear about what is required to get to the next belt level.
* We will give you feedback for next time if you did not make it.
* An element of Social Good is desirable - (e.g. mentoring others in the Dojo, making a website for a charity, teach elderly people to use the net, build something for Hackspace etc.)

# Applying for a Belt
‘Applying’ sounds very formal, but the basic idea is that anyone once can request to be assessed for
a Belt. Mentors then discuss with that person what is needed for the next belt for them and agree
between the how best to demonstrate them.

1.	 Learn Skills - these are the practical skills that are picked up at Dojos week in, week out
1.	 Put Skills into Practice - demonstrate that skills are understood and are being put into practice together, not just transcribed.
1.	 Recognition - Belts are awarded based on recognition from Mentors and peers.

# Notes
* Pick a week to award belts. The end of term or a final session of a series is often good.
* Explain what was needed to be a yellow or blue belt
* Work one to one with everyone to set a challenge of interest to them to achieve a belt
* Mentors evaluate if the challenge is achieved and is enough to award a belt
* Award the belt or provide feedback on how to take the project a bit further to be ready
* next time (see ‘Making the Decision to Award a Belt’ below)

# Guidelines for Awarding Belts
* Agreement and consistency is absolutely key to this so you can ensure a unanimous decision
process and importantly support and guidance if the Dojo member is not ready.
* To ensure the rules did not change with the mentor we agreed that:
  * at least 2 mentors would have to agree that the Dojo member was ready to go for his/
her belt.
  * that any of the mentors involved could veto the decision
  * veto would be respected (no arguments! :)

* If someone is not ready to be considered for a higher belt they must be given clear guidance
on what they needed to work on to be ready next time.

* It is important to follow the ‘Above All, Be Cool’ philosophy here. It is not cool to upset
someone or make them feel a failure - so approaching things sensitively is important but
equally it is not cool to make an award that has no real worth or meaning, so a balance is
needed.
