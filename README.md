# **Acknowledgement**
* This belt scheme is a work in progress and is adapted and remixed from the CoderDojo Ireland belts guide, which I found [here](http://kata.coderdojo.com/wiki/Belts). Further notes on the thought process behind the adaptation can be found in the NOTES.md file in this repo.
* Our sincere thanks are offered to the CoderDojo Ireland team and to the authors of the original from which our belt system takes its inspiration and much of its content.

# General Rules

* No one has a right to a belt - it must be earned. No [grandfather clauses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_clause) exist for the people who run the Code Club / Dojo - everyone will need to go through the belts progressively. It's reasonable to consider double-grading (incrementing two belts in one grading) for very experienced people
* We (mentors, parents and all club members) will help you get there.
* We will be clear about what is required to get to the next belt level.
* We will give you feedback for next time if you did not make it.
* An element of Social Good is desirable - (e.g. mentoring others in the Dojo, making a website for a charity, teach elderly people to use the net, build something for Hackspace etc.)


# Indicating which Belt grade someone is on

* CoderDojo Ireland used a series of USB drives with the appropriate coloured  silicone wrist-strap. We are not planning to do this at Leigh Hackspace because of: a) the cost of USB drives, b) the limited real-world utility of USB sticks in a cloud-based world, c) in 10 years time nobody is going to be impressed by even the largest currently-available USB stick, d) USB sticks that are available in multicoloured silicone bands tend to be poor quality and unbranded.
* Martial Arts schools use actual belts, made of fabric, which are tied around the waist. I'm not sure this is quite right for a Code school either.
* We are considering just using a simple silicone wrist band, such as those used for charity campaigns, which we could get embossed with 'Leigh Hackspace Code Club'. This keeps it simple, is the kind of thing children might be persuaded to wear, and is low in cost.


# Code Belt System

## White Belt
* Understand the Hackspace rule - Be Excellent To Each Other! +
* Attend 5 Code Club sessions +
* Create and finish a basic project in any 'beginner' language (such as Scratch, block.ly, or for the more advanced beginner: Ruby, Python, Javascript etc) +
* Show your understanding of the concepts you have learned by explaining your application to a mentor.
* <WIP>

## Yellow Belt
* Create a project, as agreed with a mentor.
* Understand the coding concepts you have used in your project and be able to explain them to a mentor.
* Share your project with others.
* <WIP>

## Orange Belt
* Have previously earned the yellow belt.
* <WIP>

## Green Belt
* Have previously earned the orange belt.
* Complete the CodeCademy track for a language of your choice (suggested: JavaScript, Python, Ruby)
* <WIP>

## Blue Belt
* Have previously earned the green belt.
* Help to mentor at the Dojo.
* Complete the CodeCademy track (or similar alternative) for at least two common languages (suggested: JavaScript, Python, Ruby)
* <WIP>

## Purple Belt
* Have previously earned the blue belt.
* Purple belts to be awarded by the mentors as a group
for especially advanced projects.
* <WIP>

## Brown Belt
* Have previously earned the purple belt.
* <WIP>

## Advanced Brown Belt
* Have previously earned the brown belt.
* <WIP>

## Black Belt
* Have previously earned the advanced brown belt.
* Regularly teaches and mentors at Code Club
* Has made, and continues to make, a significant contribution to an open source project.
* Black belts to be awarded by the mentors as a group for especially advanced projects, provided that equivalent competency at all preceding belts levels can be shown.

## Beyond Black Belt - Dan Grades
* Most martial arts belt systems have the concept of 'teacher' grades, or 'Dan' which are awarded for time served after black belt is awarded.
* Ongoing regular teaching and mentoring at Code Club counts towards your 'Dan'.
* At this level, it is also desirable to be leading the coder students by example, by contributing to open source projects. You may even be a maintainer of such a project.
* It's very hard to be prescriptive about what sort of achievements and ongoing work constitutes eligibility for further Dan grades. Arguably, there's no further need for prgression beyond Black Belt, since the belt system is primarily aimed at encouraging children and young people to take up coding and progress their achievements. Once they reach Black Belt they are likely to want to stay a coder for its own merits, and will have found other forms of motivation and guidance for their learning and development.
* <WIP>

# Notes

## Applying for a Belt
‘Applying’ sounds very formal, but the basic idea is that anyone once can request to be assessed for a Belt. Mentors then discuss with that person what is needed for the next belt for them and agree between the how best to demonstrate them.

1.	 **Learn Skills** - these are the practical skills that are picked up at Dojos week in, week out.
1.	 **Put Skills into Practice** - demonstrate that skills are understood and are being put into practice together, not just transcribed.
1.	 **Recognition** - Belts are awarded based on recognition from Mentors and peers.

## Notes
* Pick a week to award belts. The end of term or a final session of a series is often good.
* Explain what was needed to be the required belt level in question.
* Work one to one with everyone to set a challenge of interest to them to achieve a belt.
* Mentors evaluate if the challenge is achieved and is enough to award a belt.
* Award the belt or provide feedback on how to take the project a bit further to be ready next time (see ‘Making the Decision to Award a Belt’ below)

# Guidelines for Awarding Belts

* Agreement and consistency is absolutely key to this so you can ensure a unanimous decision process and importantly support and guidance if the Dojo member is not ready.

* To ensure the rules did not change with the mentor we agreed that:
  * at least 2 mentors would have to agree that the Dojo member was ready to go for his/
her belt.
  * that any of the mentors involved could veto the decision
  * veto would be respected (no arguments! :)

* If someone is not ready to be considered for a higher belt they must be given clear guidance on what they needed to work on to be ready next time.

* It is important to follow the ‘Above All, Be Cool’ philosophy here. It is not cool to upset someone or make them feel a failure - so approaching things sensitively is important but equally it is not cool to make an award that has no real worth or meaning, so a balance is needed.
